This will be his first time venturing in to the North American food restaurant market and he would like to open it first either in New York or Toronto.  He would like us to recommend him the ideal venue for his restaurant by leveraging our expertise and knowledge.\n\nNew York and Toronto are both the largest cities of their respective countries, where New York is the financial hub of the United States of America and similarly Toronto is the financial hub of Canada. Both the cities have high population density, higher cost of living, and varied ethnicities and lifestyle. The objective of this project is to find the similarities and differences between New York and Toronto based on their individual neighbourhoods and popularity of Italian restaurants to identify and recommend the most suitable venue for John Smith's signature Italian restaurant."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Data Description:\n\nWe will convert addresses into their equivalent latitude and longitude values using Geopy. Also, we will use the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in New York City and Toronto  to get information on neighbourhoods and restuarants, and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters. The _k_-means clustering algorithm will be used to complete this task. Finally, the Folium library will be used to visualize the neighborhoods and restuarants in New York City and Toronto along with their emerging clusters.\n\n\n\n### New York City Data\n\nNeighborhood has a total of 5 boroughs and 306 neighborhoods. In order to segement the neighborhoods and explore the restuanrants, we will essentially need a dataset that contains the 5 boroughs and the neighborhoods that exist in each borough as well as the the latitude and logitude coordinates of each neighborhood. \n\nWe will use the data set provided during the Skills Network Lab for this: [https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572](https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572?cm_mmc=Email_Newsletter-_-Developer_Ed%2BTech-_-WW_WW-_-SkillsNetwork-Courses-IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork-21253531&cm_mmca1=000026UJ&cm_mmca2=10006555&cm_mmca3=M12345678&cvosrc=email.Newsletter.M12345678&cvo_campaign=000026UJ&cm_mmc=Email_Newsletter-_-Developer_Ed%2BTech-_-WW_WW-_-SkillsNetwork-Courses-IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork-21253531&cm_mmca1=000026UJ&cm_mmca2=10006555&cm_mmca3=M12345678&cvosrc=email.Newsletter.M12345678&cvo_campaign=000026UJ)\n\n\n### Toronto City Data\n\nFor the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page exists (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M) that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. We will scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format like the New York dataset.\n\nOnce the data is in a structured format, we will replicate the analysis that we did to the New York City dataset to explore and cluster the neighborhoods and restuarants in the city of Toronto."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
